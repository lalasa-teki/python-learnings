Bitwise Operators
Identity and Membership Operators
Expressions and Operator Precedence
1. Arithmetic Operators:
These operators are used to perform mathematical operations.

Operator	Description	Example
+	Addition	x + y
-	Subtraction	x - y
*	Multiplication	x * y
/	Division	x / y
%	Modulus	x % y
**	Exponentiation	x ** y
//	Floor Division	x // y
Examples:

python
Copy code
a = 10
b = 3

print(a + b)  # 13
print(a - b)  # 7
print(a * b)  # 30
print(a / b)  # 3.3333333333333335
print(a % b)  # 1
print(a ** b) # 1000
print(a // b) # 3
2. Comparison Operators:
These operators are used to compare two values.

Operator	Description	Example
==	Equal to	x == y
!=	Not equal to	x != y
>	Greater than	x > y
<	Less than	x < y
>=	Greater than or equal to	x >= y
<=	Less than or equal to	x <= y
Examples:

python
Copy code
x = 5
y = 8

print(x == y)  # False
print(x != y)  # True
print(x > y)   # False
print(x < y)   # True
print(x >= y)  # False
print(x <= y)  # True
3. Logical Operators:
These operators are used to combine conditional statements.

Operator	Description	Example
and	Logical AND	x and y
or	Logical OR	x or y
not	Logical NOT	not x
Examples:

python
Copy code
x = True
y = False

print(x and y)  # False
print(x or y)   # True
print(not x)    # False
4. Assignment Operators:
These operators are used to assign values to variables.

Operator	Description	Example
=	Assignment	x = 5
+=	Add and assign	x += 3
-=	Subtract and assign	x -= 3
*=	Multiply and assign	x *= 3
/=	Divide and assign	x /= 3
%=	Modulus and assign	x %= 3
**=	Exponent and assign	x **= 3
//=	Floor divide and assign	x //= 3
Examples:

python
Copy code
x = 5
x += 3  # x = x + 3
print(x)  # 8

x -= 2  # x = x - 2
print(x)  # 6

x *= 2  # x = x * 2
print(x)  # 12

x /= 3  # x = x / 3
print(x)  # 4.0

x %= 2  # x = x % 2
print(x)  # 0.0

x = 2
x **= 3  # x = x ** 3
print(x)  # 8

x //= 3  # x = x // 3
print(x)  # 2
5. Bitwise Operators:
These operators are used to perform bit-level operations.

Operator	Description	Example
&	Bitwise AND	x & y
`	`	Bitwise OR
^	Bitwise XOR	x ^ y
~	Bitwise NOT	~x
<<	Bitwise left shift	x << 2
>>	Bitwise right shift	x >> 2
Examples:

python
Copy code
x = 10  # 1010 in binary
y = 4   # 0100 in binary

print(x & y)  # 0 (0000)
print(x | y)  # 14 (1110)
print(x ^ y)  # 14 (1110)
print(~x)     # -11 (inverts bits)
print(x << 2) # 40 (101000)
print(x >> 2) # 2 (10)
6. Identity and Membership Operators:
Identity Operators:
These operators compare the memory locations of two objects.

Operator	Description	Example
is	Identity	x is y
is not	Not Identity	x is not y
Examples:

python
Copy code
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x

print(x is z)      # True
print(x is y)      # False
print(x == y)      # True
print(x is not y)  # True
Membership Operators:
These operators test if a sequence contains a specified element.

Operator	Description	Example
in	Membership	x in y
not in	Not Membership	x not in y
Examples:

python
Copy code
x = ["apple", "banana"]

print("banana" in x)      # True
print("cherry" not in x)  # True
7. Expressions and Operator Precedence:
An expression is a combination of variables, operators, and values that yields a result value. Operator precedence determines the order in which operations are performed.

Operator Precedence Table:

** (Exponentiation)
+x, -x, ~x (Unary plus, Unary minus, Bitwise NOT)
*, /, //, % (Multiplication, Division, Floor division, Modulus)
+, - (Addition, Subtraction)
<<, >> (Bitwise shift)
& (Bitwise AND)
^ (Bitwise XOR)
| (Bitwise OR)
==, !=, >, <, >=, <=, is, is not, in, not in (Comparisons, Identity, Membership)
not (Logical NOT)
and (Logical AND)
or (Logical OR)
Examples:

python
Copy code
# Expression with multiple operators
result = 3 + 5 * 2
print(result)  # 13 (5*2 is evaluated first)

# Using parentheses to change order
result = (3 + 5) * 2
print(result)  # 16
Day 3 Exercises:
Arithmetic and Assignment Practice:

Use assignment operators to modify a variable and print the intermediate results.
Comparison and Logical Practice:

Write a script that compares two numbers and prints the results of various comparison and logical operations.
Bitwise Operators Practice:
