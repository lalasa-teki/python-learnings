#### **1. Python Overview:**
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

**Key Features:**
- Easy to read and write
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Strong community support

#### **2. Installing Python:**

**Windows:**
1. Download the Python installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Run the installer and make sure to check "Add Python to PATH".
3. Follow the installation steps.

**macOS:**
1. Python 2.x is pre-installed, but it's recommended to use Python 3.x.
2. Download the installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3. Run the installer.

**Linux:**
1. Open the terminal.
2. Use the package manager to install Python. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3
   ```

**Verify the Installation:**
Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
python --version
# or
python3 --version
```

#### **3. Basic Syntax:**

Python syntax is clean and easy to read. Here's a simple example:

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This prints a string to the console
```

**Indentation:**
Python uses indentation to define blocks of code. Consistent indentation is crucial.

```python
if True:
    print("This is indented correctly")
```

#### **4. Interactive Python Shell:**

The interactive shell, also known as the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), allows you to execute Python commands one at a time and see the results immediately.

To start the Python interactive shell, open a terminal or command prompt and type:
```bash
python
# or
python3
```

You should see a prompt like this:
```python
>>>
```

Now you can type Python commands directly. For example:
```python
>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!
>>> 2 + 3
5
```

#### **5. Writing and Running Your First Python Script:**

**Step 1: Create a Python File**
Open a text editor and write the following code:
```python
# hello.py
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Step 2: Save the File**
Save the file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `hello.py`.

**Step 3: Run the Script**
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved your script. Then type:
```bash
python hello.py
# or
python3 hello.py
```

You should see the output:
```plaintext
Hello, World!
```

### **Day 1 Exercises:**

1. **Interactive Shell Practice:**
   - Open the Python shell and practice basic commands like addition, subtraction, and string manipulation.

2. **Script Writing:**
   - Write a Python script that prints your name, age, and a favorite quote.

3. **Exploring Errors:**
   - Intentionally write some incorrect code to see what kinds of errors you get. For example, forget to close a string with a quote or misalign the indentation.
